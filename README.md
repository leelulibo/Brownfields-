# Toy Worlds

## Description
Toy Worlds is a Java-based grid-based world simulation where robots navigate, interact with their environment, and engage in various actions such as movement, firing weapons, and deploying mines. The simulation is managed by a server, and clients can connect to the server to observe the world state and control robots.

## Features
- Grid-based world simulation
- Robot navigation with movement and rotation
- Shield protection and repair functionality
- Weapon systems with firing capabilities
- Deployment of mines
- Console interface for server management
- Client connectivity for observing and controlling robots
- Flexible UI design options for clients

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://gitlab.wethinkco.de/mchristi021/toy-worlds-21cpt18.git
    ```
2. Compile the Java source files:
    ```
    cd toy-worlds-21cpt18
    javac *.java
    ```
3. Run the server:
    ```
    java Server
    ```
4. Connect clients to the server to observe and control robots.

## Usage
- Launch the server and configure parameters such as grid dimensions, shield repair time, and weapon reload time.
- Connect clients to the server using the specified IP address and port.
- Control robots, observe the world state, and interact with the simulation through the chosen UI design in the client.
